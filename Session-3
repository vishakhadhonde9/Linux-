*Architecture Of Linux OS-
Linux architecture consist of inner most Hardware layer, kernel, shell, and 
outer application layer.

1) Application Layer: 
Users interact with the system through varies applications such as office, games, etc.
These applications run in outer layer of architecture.

2) Shell:  
Shell provides environment to run any application.
It provides interface to the user to interact with hardware.
Shell act as command interpreter.
Shell can be of:
i) Graphical Shell
ii) Command line Shell
Examples: k shell, bash shell, sh shell, etc.

3) Kernel:
Kernel is core component of Linux architecture.
It convert high level language into computer level language.
Manages hardwares (CPU, Memory and devices).
It tracks all active processes running on systems.
In Linux, we use Monolithic kernel.

Monolithic kernel vs microlithic kernel-

Monolithic Kernel-
It manages system's resources between system applications and system hardware.
Dependencies which are required for system applications are already installed.
Large in size and provides high execution speed.
All prerequisites are already installed required to install new packeges.
It offers memory management, file management and process scheduling.

Microservices-
In microlithic kernel, only required dependencies are pre-installed.
lightweight in size
Application softwares running on microlithic architecture have ability to install its
own dependencies by itself.
It is slow in execution.

4) Hardware:
