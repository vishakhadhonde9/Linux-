*Architecture Of Linux OS-
Linux architecture consist of inner most Hardware layer, kernel, shell, and 
outer application layer.

1) Application Layer: 
Users interact with the system through varies applications such as office, games, etc.
These applications run in outer layer of architecture.

2) Shell:  
Shell provides environment to run any application.
It provides interface to the user to interact with hardware.
Shell act as command interpreter.
Shell can be of:
i) Graphical Shell
ii) Command line Shell
Examples: k shell, bash shell, sh shell, etc.

3) Kernel:
Kernel is core component of Linux architecture.
It convert high level language into computer level language.
Manages hardwares (CPU, Memory and devices).
It tracks all active processes running on systems.
In Linux, we use Monolithic kernel.
