# What is Operating System?

- An Operating System or OS is the program which provides an environment to run other applications. 
- OS interacts with hardware which means it acts as mediator between hardware and user interface.
- It manages hardware, software and memory resources.

# Why we required Operating System?
- Operating system plays a crucial role in computer system, it allows you to interact with computers without knowing how to speak in computer's language.
- It acts as interpreter or translator as it translates human readable (high level) language into machine level (binary or low level in 0's or 1's format) language.

# History of Linux-

In earlier days, computers were as big as houses or parks. So, you can imagine how difficult it 
was to operate them. Moreover, every computer has a different operating system which made it 
completely worse to operate on them. Every software was designed for a specific purpose and was 
unable to operate on other computer. It were extremely costly and normal people neither can afford 
it nor can understand it.
- **1969 (UNIX)**   -    Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie      -    developed at AT&T Bell labs. It is not free.
- **1983 (GNU Project)**   -    Richard Stallman       -     free version of UNIX
- **1991 (LINUX)**    -      Linus Torvalds       -      make first Linux kernel which is freely available to anyone.

Linux is a kernel and not an operating system and GNU is a collection of free software, these two project collabs give us “Linux” or “GNU/Linux” operating system.
