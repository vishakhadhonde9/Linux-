Features of Linux -
1) Open Source- The source code of Linux OS is openly available to anyone. 
                Anyone can open it, expand it and modify it as required.
                Simply open source means have freedom to:
                    -run program, for any purposes.
                    -study how program works and change it.
                    -distribute versions.

2) Free- Free to use this OS for personal use, on the server, and for educational use.
         A free License and collaborative project that can be developed by the user contribution.

3) Security- Linux is more secure OS:
                 -Limited permissions
                 -Super user and standard user privileges
                 -Open source- allowing anyone to inspect, modify and improve code
                               enable large community to fix vulnerabilities
                 -A global development community look at different ways to enhance its security, 
                  hence it is highly secured and robust so you don't need an anti virus to scan it regularly.

4) Lightweight- Required less hardware resources.
                4-8 GB hard disk space required to install.
