# User Management in Linux-
- A user is a person who utilizes a computer or network service.
- Linux is said to be secure because one user cannot access files of other user without its permission.
- Each user is assigned an ID that is unique for each user in the operating system.
## There are three types of user:
### 1. System user: 
- System accounts are used by the services in Linux system.
- These accounts or users generally created when services are installed in system. 
### 2. Super user: 
- Super users are those users who has all privileges of Linux system.
- On all Linux systems, by default there is the user root, also known as the super user.
- This account is used for managing Linux. Root, for instance, can create other user accounts on the system.
- For some tasks, root privileges are required. Some examples are installing software, managing users, and creating partitions on disk devices. 
### 3. Standard user: 
- local user accounts or standard user accounts are for the people who need to work on a system and who need limited access to the resources on that system.
- These user accounts typically have a password that is used for authenticating the user to the system.
# Adding New User-
- Adding new local user means creating user account.                                                                                                       
- User can be added by root user or using root user’s privileges.
- Whenever new user has been added, some files get affected. These files holds user accounts related information.                                           - Also whenever new user is created, by default, its home directory has been generated.
