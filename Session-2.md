# Features of Linux -
## 1) Open Source- 
               The source code of Linux OS is openly available to anyone. 
                Anyone can open it, expand it and modify it as required.
                Simply open source means have freedom to:
                    -run program, for any purposes.
                    -study how program works and change it.
                    -distribute versions.

## 2) Free- 
         Free to use this OS for personal use, on the server, and for educational use.
         A free License and collaborative project that can be developed by the user contribution.

## 3) Security- 
            Linux is more secure OS:
                 -Limited permissions
                 -Super user and standard user privileges
                 -Open source- allowing anyone to inspect, modify and improve code
                               enable large community to fix vulnerabilities
                 -A global development community look at different ways to enhance its security, 
                  hence it is highly secured and robust so you don't need an anti virus to scan it regularly.

## 4) Lightweight-
                Required less hardware resources.
                4-8 GB hard disk space required to install.
                it can be installed on any small hardware and it uses quite small disk space while installation.

## 5) Multiuser Capability- 
                An operating system that allows and grants permission to multiple users to access underlying hardware resources simultaneously.
                Multiple users can access the same system resources like memory, hard disk, etc. 

## 6) Multitasking-
                 It allows numerous users to work on various tasks at once.
                 There are two approaches to this:
                     -Single users doing multiple tasks.
                     -Multiple users do multiple tasks which includes editing file, and using browsing facility at the same time.
